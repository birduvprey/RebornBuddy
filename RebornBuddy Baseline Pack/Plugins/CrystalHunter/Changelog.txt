v1.1
Updated to include movement code for Idyllshire


v1.2
Hopefully fixed teleport to next zone issue

v1.3
Added a check for nodules (on by default).
If you have any nodules in your inventory it will ignore the crystals required for it.

v2.0
Rewritten the internal logic.
Movement in Idyllshire should now be fixed...
	Set Idyllshire Aetheryte Unlocked to true if you have unlocked the Aetheryte to move out
Allow setting of jobs per zone.
	You can choose to turn this on / off - If you're running multiple combat routines be wary of RebornBuddy prompting for the routine to use.

v2.1
Fixed a bug with having Astral / Umbral nodules in inventory whereby if you have one the plugin braks out of the contained code
